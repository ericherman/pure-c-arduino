raw-c-arduino

Experimenting with using plain-old raw C for programming the
Arduino platform.

This is the @ericherman workbook for exploring the hardware.
Currently this is only looking at avr-based Arduinos.

The Arduino hardware and libraries have opened an amazing number of
doors for many people. The focus on ease-of-use has surely been a
big advantage in this.  The trade-offs in favor of simplicity
naturally obfuscates some of the low-level interaction with the
hardware. Some of the library choices while likely very good for the
beginner do little to empower advanced learning; perhaps this
project will serve that end.


How-to:
--------

Look in "src" to find the raw-c "blink.c" which is similar to
the Arduino example "blink.ino", or the "hello-serial.c" which is
shows very basic serial communication.

The Makefile tries not to be too magical, look there to set the
parameters matching the hardware. Currently Arduino Mega2560 is the
default.

The Makefile assumes "avr-gcc" is in the PATH. An avr-gcc toolchain
can be built using:

	https://github.com/ericherman/avr-toolchain-build

Use "make" to build the firmware.

Use "make upload-blink" or "make upload-hello-serial" to push the
firmware to the arduino.

To test "hello-serial", GNU Screen can be used:
	screen -l /dev/ttyUSB0
or
	screen -l /dev/ttyACM0

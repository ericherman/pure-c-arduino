pure-c-arduino

Experimenting with using plain-old pure C for programming the
Arduino platform.

This is the @ericherman workbook for exploring the hardware.
Currently this is only looking at avr-based Arduinos.

The Arduino hardware and libraries have opened an amazing number of
doors for many people. The focus on ease-of-use has surely been a
big advantage in this.  The trade-offs in favor of simplicity
naturally obfuscates some of the low-level interaction with the
hardware. Some of the library choices while likely very good for the
beginner do little to empower advanced learning; perhaps this
project will serve that end.


How-to:
--------

look in "01-basics" to find the pure-c "blink.c" which is similar to
the Arduino example "blink.ino".

The 01-basics/Makefile tries not to be too magical, look there to
set the parameters matching the hardware. Currently Arduino Mega2560
is the default.

Use "make" to build the firmware.

Use "make upload-blink" to push the firmware to the arduino.
